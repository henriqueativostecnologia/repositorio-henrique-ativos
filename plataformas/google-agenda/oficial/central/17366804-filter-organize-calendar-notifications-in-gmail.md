# Filter & organize Calendar notifications  in Gmail

To keep your inbox organized, you can use Gmail filters. This helps you manage calendars for other people or a team.

When Google Calendar sends an email, it contains a hidden email header called `X-Google-Calendar-Notification`, which Gmail can read. For example, this includes when a:

- Meeting time changes.
- Room is removed.
- Guest adds a note to their reply.

## Step 1: Set up notifications in Calendar

Before you create filters in Gmail, turn on the notifications you want in Google Calendar:

1.  On your computer, open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
2.  At the top right, click Settings menu and then **Settings**.
3.  On the left, under "Settings for my calendars," click the name of the calendar.
4.  Click **Other notifications**.
5.  Next to each category, such as "Changed events" or "Event responses," click the dropdown menu.
6.  Select **Email** or **None**.

## Step 2: Create a filter in Gmail

After you set up your notification settings, you can use custom filters in Gmail to search for specific event notifications.

1.  On your computer, open [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/).
2.  In the search box at the top, enter a query using a value from the table below.
    - For example, “`header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpDeclined`.”
3.  On the right side of the search box, click Show search options .
4.  At the bottom of the window, click **Create filter**.
5.  Choose what you want the filter to do, such as archive, label, or delete the email.
6.  Click **Create filter**.

### Filter tokens for Calendar notifications

To filter a specific action, combine `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:` with one of the search tokens below. For example, to filter new event invitations, use `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:eventCreated`.

|                        |                                   |                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Category**           | **Notification action**           | **Search token**          |
| New & cancelled events | New event invitation sent         | `eventCreated`            |
| New & cancelled events | Event cancelled                   | `eventCancelled`          |
| Event updates          | Time or recurrence rules changed  | `timeOrRecurrenceUpdated` |
| Event updates          | Meeting room added                | `roomAdded`               |
| Event updates          | Meeting room removed              | `roomRemoved`             |
| Event updates          | Location changed                  | `locationUpdated`         |

| Event updates          | Description changed               | `descriptionUpdated`      |
| Event updates          | Document or attachment added      | `attachmentAdded`         |
| Event updates          | Document or attachment removed    | `attachmentRemoved`       |
| Event updates          | Video conferencing link updated   | `conferenceUpdated`       |
| Guest RSVPs            | Guest accepted invitation         | `rsvpAccepted`            |
| Guest RSVPs            | Guest declined invitation         | `rsvpDeclined`            |
| Guest RSVPs            | Guest responded “Maybe”           | `rsvpTentative`           |
| Guest RSVPs            | Guest included a note with RSVP   | `rsvpWithNote`            |
| Guest RSVPs            | Guest proposed a new meeting time | `rsvpProposeNewTime`      |
| Room RSVPs             | Meeting room accepted booking     | `roomAccepted`            |
| Room RSVPs             | Meeting room declined booking     | `roomDeclined`            |

Here are a few ways you can combine these operators to organize your inbox:

- **To keep only RSVP declines with a note, and archive all other RSVPs:**
  - **To label important notes:**
    - Create a filter with the query:
      `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpDeclined`
      `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpWithNote`.
    - Set the action to: Apply label “Urgent RSVPs.”
  - **To archive routine RSVPs:**
    - Create a filter with the query:
      `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpAccepted OR`
      `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpTentative OR`
      `(header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpDeclined`
      `-header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:rsvpWithNote).`
    - Set the action to: “Skip the Inbox (Archive it).”
- **To find a declined meeting room booking:**
  - Create a filter with the query:
    `header:X-Google-Calendar-Notification:roomDeclined`.
  - Set the action to: Apply label “Room Conflicts” or “Mark as important.”
