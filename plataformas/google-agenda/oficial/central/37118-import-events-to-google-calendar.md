# Import events to Google Calendar

This article has different instructions for each platform/version: Computer, Android phone & tablet, iPhone & iPad. All versions are copied below.

## Version: Computer

You can transfer your events from a different calendar application or Google Account to Google Calendar.

When you import an event, guests and conference data for that event are not imported.

### Step 1: Export events

Export your events as a file that you can import into Google. Choose one of these options:

##### Export from another calendar application

You can export your events from most calendar applications, such Outlook Calendar or Apple Calendar.

1.  Open the calendar application where your events are currently stored.
    - **Tip:** It's usually easier to do this task from a computer than from a mobile device.
2.  Find an option to Export.
3.  Choose a file format:
    - If you can choose from different file formats, choose CSV.
    - If you use an Apple device, choose vCard.

For more help, check your calendar application's help center or try to use the words “export calendar” in your search.

Your file is stored on your computer where your downloads are usually saved or in the place you chose when you exported.

##### Export from a different Google Account

If you have more than one Google Account, you can export your calendars from one account and import them into another.

1.  On a computer, sign in to the Google Account that you want to export from. You can only export from a computer, not a phone or tablet.
2.  [To export your calendar, follow these steps](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111). 
3.  When you export your calendar, download an .ics file to your computer.
4.  Sign in to the Google Account where you want to import.
5.  To import your calendar, continue to “Create or edit .csv and  iCal files before you import.”

**Tip:** Imported events don't stay in sync between your 2 accounts. If you want your calendars to sync, [share your calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082) with the other account.

### Step 2: Import events into Google Calendar

​After you export your events, you can import them into Google Calendar. You can import with ICS and CSV files on a computer. 

1.  Open [*Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com).

2.  In the top right, click Settings and then **Settings**.

3.  In the menu on the left, click **Import & Export**.

4.  Click **Select file from your computer** and select the file you exported. The file should end in ".ics" or ".csv."

5.   Choose which calendar to add the imported events to.
    - By default, events are imported into your primary calendar.

6.  Click **Import**.

7.  If you have a .zip file, find it on your computer and open it. You'll find .ics files for each of your calendars. Take the individual files out of the .zip file, and import each .ics file individually.

If you import repeat events from a .csv file, they might not show up that way. They'll be on your calendar as a series of one-time events.

### Advanced: Create or edit .csv or iCal files before you import

##### Create or edit a .csv file

You can import .csv (comma separated values) files into Google Calendar. If you get an error when you import a .csv file, you might be able to fix the formatting.

Open a .csv file or create one with a spreadsheet editor like [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

The first row of your new spreadsheet includes headers like “Subject” and “Start Date.” To import into Google Calendar, the headers must be in English. For the correct headers you need to import into Calendar, go to the list below.

Each row below the header row represents an event. For example:

|                  |                  |                |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| `Subject`        | `Start date`     | `Start time`   |
| **`Final exam`** | **`05/30/2020`** | **`10:00 AM`** |

When you're done, save the file as a .csv file. Then, to import the file into Google Calendar, follow the steps in “Import events into Google Calendar.”

##### Format headers & events in .csv files

Only the first 2 headers in this list are required. The rest are optional.

**Important:** The headers must be in English as shown in this article. If any event details have commas (like the location example given), you can include them with quotation marks around the text.

- `Subject`
  (Required) The name of the event
  Example: `Final exam`
- `Start Date`
  (Required) The first day of the event
  Example: `05/30/2020`
- `Start Time`
  The time the event begins
  Example: `10:00 AM`
- `End Date`
  The last day of the event
  Example: `05/30/2020`
- `End Time`
  The time the event ends
  Example: `1:00 PM`
- `All Day Event`
  Whether the event is an all-day event. 
  - **If it’s an all-day event,** enter `True`. 
  - **If it isn’t an all-day event,** enter `False`.
    Example: `False`
- `Description`
  Description or notes about the event
  Example: `"50 multiple choice questions and two essay questions"`
- `Location`
  The location for the event
  Example: `"Columbia, Schermerhorn 614"`
- `Private`
  Whether the event should be marked private.
  - **If it’s private,** enter `True`.
  - **If it isn’t private,** enter `False`.
    Example: `True`

These examples would create the following event:

- **Event:** "Final exam" on May 30, 2020 10:00 AM–1:00 PM 
- **Location:** "Columbia, Schermerhorn 614" 
- **Description:** "50 multiple choice questions and two essay questions"
- **Private:** Private event

##### Create or edit an iCalendar file

iCalendar files are a standard calendar format used to transfer calendar data. If you get an error when you import an iCalendar file (.ics), you might be able to fix the formatting.

1.  With a text editor application that can save .ics files, open an .ics file or create one.
2.  Format your file with the guidelines below.
    - You can export an .ics file from Google Calendar to use as an example.
3.  When you're done, save the file as an .ics file.

##### Format iCalendar files

The first line in an iCalendar file must always be the header `BEGIN:VCALENDAR`. Other header information, such as `VERSION:2.0` and `"PRODID:<`{enter ID information here}`>"`, must follow this header. The last line of the file must be the footer `END:VCALENDAR`. Between these lines, enter  all the events in the calendar. Each event must be between `BEGIN:VEVENT` and `END:VEVENT` lines.

If you must manually edit an iCalendar file, make sure that each file contains the header and footer. If you're not sure where your header ends, copy and paste the text until one line above `BEGIN:VEVENT`. This location is where your header ends and your event data starts.

Here's what an iCalendar file looks like. An iCalendar file can also have more information, but these are the required parts.

`BEGIN:VCALENDAR`

`VERSION:2.0`

`PRODID:<` {enter ID information here} `>`

{Other header information}

`BEGIN:VEVENT`

{Event details}

`END:VEVENT`

`BEGIN:VEVENT`

{Event details}

`END:VEVENT`

`END:VCALENDAR`
