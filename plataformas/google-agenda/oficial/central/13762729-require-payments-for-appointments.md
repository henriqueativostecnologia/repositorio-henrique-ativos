# Require payments for appointments

To simplify payments and prevent last minute cancellations, you can ask customers to pay in advance on your appointment schedule in Google Calendar.

## Learn how paid appointments work

- Paid appointment bookings are a premium feature for appointment schedules and available to users with an eligible Google Workspace subscription. [Compare premium features for appointment schedules](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/16287038).
- To require payments, you need to connect Google Calendar to a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/).
- When customers choose a time slot on your booking page, they checkout and pay for the appointment using Stripe to complete the booking process.
- Customers can only select credit card payment, Apple Pay, and Google Pay as payment options.
- Currencies are provided by Stripe. [Learn about accepted currencies on Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
- If your Google Workspace account is managed by an organization, your administrator controls access to paid appointment bookings. If you don’t see this feature, contact your administrator.

## Disconnect Stripe from Google Calendar

**Important:** After you disconnect Stripe, all appointment schedules no longer require payment.

1.  In Google Calendar, at the top right, click Settings menu and then **Settings**.
2.  On the left, click **General** and then **Appointment schedules**.
3.  Select the option to disconnect Stripe.

## Learn about payments & refunds for appointments

All payments and refunds are handled by Stripe. Google Calendar does not:

- Process or store any payment info, such as credit card numbers
- Charge any platform fees
- Assist with payment or refund issues

When you cancel an appointment as the organizer or the customer, a refund isn’t processed automatically.

- **If you’re the organizer:** To refund the customer, go to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).
- **If you’re the customer:** To request a refund for an appointment cancellation, review the organizer’s cancellation policy first, then contact them to ask for a refund.

## Learn about information shared between Stripe & Calendar

After you connect Stripe to Google Calendar, some appointment information is shared with Stripe, including:

- Price
- Appointment title
- Time slot

To manage the data that Stripe uses, go to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login). If you no longer want to use Stripe, disconnect Stripe from Google Calendar.
