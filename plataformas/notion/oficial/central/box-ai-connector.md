## FAQs

What data does Notion AI Box Connector get access to?

Notion AI can read all Box files and folders associated with the connected account.

Does Notion AI respect my Box permissions?

Yes. Notion AI strictly follows existing permissions as outlined in our [Notion AI Security Practices](https://www.notion.so/help/notion-ai-security-practices). Users can only generate content and receive responses about files they have permission to access in Box.  
  
Box Permissions are inherited downward from parent folders.  
**Example: **In Box → Folder 1 \> Folder 2 \> Folder 3 \> text.txt\`

- If a user has access to Folder 1, they will have access to Folder 2 and Folder 3.

- The user can not have access to Folder 1 but not Folder 2 or Folder 3

- If user has access to Folder 3 they would not have access to Folder 1 or Folder 2 unless directly granted access.

- text.txt is accessible to everyone who is directly granted access or has access to Folder 3 or has access to Folder 2 or Folder 1.

In Box, shared links are an overlay that can expand access beyond collaborators depending on link scope. For example, you can customize the link's access permissions, like setting it to be accessible only to people within your company or to anyone with the link. Shared link permissions are currently not supported.

Does Notion AI respect collaboration expiration and retention rules?

Yes. When a collaboration expires, users can no longer access those files. When a file reaches the retention period, users will no longer have access to those files. Checks are performed hourly.

How long does it take for the integration to complete and how far back does it look?

The integration can take up to 3 hours to complete. Once the integration is set up, it will be able to find folders and files that were created or modified. After the initial ingestion is complete, files viewed will also become searchable.

How long does it take for Notion AI to read new Box content?

New files and folders received in Box will be available in Notion AI searches within an hour.

Can I limit the scope of my search to only Box?

Yes! In Notion AI, click `Find in` to toggle between `Everything you can access`, `Notion,` and `Box`.

Who can access Box content using Notion AI?

You must be both an Box user and a Notion workspace member to use this integration. Notion AI automatically maps Box members to their corresponding Notion accounts by email address. The system syncs permission changes every hour.

How does Notion store or reference my Box data in its systems?

Box data is not stored directly, and we do not store Box files or their contents in vector databases.

However, auxiliary statistics and data may be logged via our observability systems. These have been thoroughly vetted by our Security team as well as by an external auditor to obtain their SOC 2 Type II certification. See [this article](https://www.notion.so/help/notion-ai-security-practices) for more information.

Can I connect multiple Notion workspaces to my Box?

Yes. With the org connector, multiple Notion workspaces can connect to the same Box organization. A Box admin must enable the org connector.

How can I disconnect my Box from Notion?

Workspace owners can disconnect Box by opening Notion AI Settings in the Settings menu and clicking on the gear ⚙️ next to `Box` → `Settings` → `Disconnect`.

What happens to my Box data if I disconnect?

Notion treats your Box data with the privacy principle of data minimization in mind. If you decide to disconnect your Box from Notion AI, your Box content will immediately become unsearchable.

How many API calls does the Box AI connector use when it runs?

It depends on the number and type of questions asked. Box admins can check the API calls made Notion in Box using [reports](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043696534-Running-Reports). Choose `API Calls `as the metric and enter the app ID `2421595`.
