# Set up Identity Provider (IdP) for SCIM

In this help doc

## Learn how to set up your Identity Provider to use SCIM in Notion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To set up provisioning with [SCIM](https://www.notion.com/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim) in Notion, you’ll first need to make sure that your Identity Provider, or IdP, supports the SAML 2.0 protocol. Here are some app-specific instructions for setting up your IdP.

## [Azure](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-scim#azure)

Notion’s Azure SCIM integration supports the following provisioning features:

- Creating users.

- Removing users.

- Keeping user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Notion.

- Provisioning groups and group memberships in Notion.

- [Single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/notion-tutorial) to Notion (recommended).

### [Step 1: Configure user provisioning in Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-scim#step-1-configure-user-provisioning-in-notion)

Start by configuring Notion to support provisioning with Azure AD. To do this:

1.  Go to notion.com/settings/organization.

2.  Go to the `General` tab and select `SCIM provisioning`.

3.  Copy an existing token or select `Add token` to create a new token.

    - Notion’s SCIM tenant URL is [https://app.notion.com/scim/v2](https://app.notion.com/scim/v2), which you’ll use later.

### [Step 2: Add Notion from the Azure AD application gallery](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-scim#step-2-add-notion-from-the-azure-ad-application-gallery)

Next, you’ll want to add Notion from the Azure AD application gallery following [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal).

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user or group.

If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app **based on assignment**, you can use the following [steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to assign users and groups to the application.

If you choose to scope who will be provisioned **based solely on attributes of the user or group**, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

### [Step 3: Configure automatic user provisioning to Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-scim#step-3-configure-automatic-user-provisioning-to-notion)

To configure user provisioning in Azure:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Select `Enterprise Applications` → `All applications`.

3.  In the applications list, select `Notion`**.**

4.  Select the `Provisioning` tab.

5.  Set the `Provisioning Mode` to `Automatic`.

6.  Under the `Admin Credentials` section, input your Notion Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click `Test Connection` to ensure Azure AD can connect to Notion. If the connection fails, ensure your Notion account has Admin permissions and try again.

7.  Select `Save`.

8.  Under the `Mappings` section, select `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Notion`.

9.  Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in the `Attribute-Mapping` section.

10. Select `Save` to commit any changes.

11. Under the `Mappings` section, select `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Notion`.

12. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in the `Attribute-Mapping` section.

13. Select `Save` to commit any changes.

14. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Notion, change the `Provisioning Status` to `On` in the `Settings` section.

15. Define the users and groups that you would like to provision to Notion by choosing the desired values in `Scope` in the `Settings` section.

16. When you're ready to provision, click `Save`.

**Note:** This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in `Scope` in the `Settings` section.

The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running.
