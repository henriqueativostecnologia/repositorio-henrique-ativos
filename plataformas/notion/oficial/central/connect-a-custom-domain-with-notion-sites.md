# Connect a custom domain with Notion Sites

In this help doc

## If you already have a custom domain, you can use it with Notion Sites. Learn how to do this, both in Notion and in your DNS provider.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** This feature is only available on paid plans.

Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on. **Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider** — the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own.

## [Custom domain add-on pricing and billing](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites#custom-domain-add-on-pricing-and-billing)

Once a workspace owner on a paid plan connects a custom domain with Sites, they'll be charged an additional \$10 per month. **Note that with annual billing, you’ll unlock a discounted rate for the custom domain add-on** of an additional \$8 per month.

For each custom domain you want to use with Notion Sites, you’ll have to purchase a separate custom domain add-on. You can do this for up to 25 custom domains.

Billing for the custom domain add-on must match your billing for Notion — if you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for the custom domain. If you pay for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for the custom domain.

If you add a custom domain to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the custom domain add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.

## [Connect a custom domain](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites#connect-a-custom-domain)

To connect a custom domain with Notion Sites:

1.  Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Sites`.

2.  Next to `Domains`, select `New domain`.

3.  Select `Custom domain` → `Continue`. You’ll be prompted to set up a payment method for this add-on if you don’t already have one on file.

4.  Enter your custom domain → `Continue`.

    There are a few important rules to follow when adding your domain to ensure a smooth setup:

    - You must already have purchased your domain from a DNS provider.

    - When entering your domain, **you must include a subdomain**. This is typically `www`, but any other subdomain works too (ex.: `careers.my-domain.com` or `portfolio.my-domain.com`).

    If you want your root domain to point to your Notion Site, we recommend setting up your subdomain to `www` and setting up a redirect with your DNS provider. Here are some instructions from common providers for how to set this up:

5.  You’ll be prompted to go to your DNS provider and add a CNAME record for the domain you want to connect. Set the CNAME target to `external.notion.site.`. Note the period at the end of the CNAME target!

6.  Next, add a TXT record for the domain. You can copy the record name and value for easy use.

7.  Select `Verify`.

Once you add a custom domain, you’ll see it and its status in your list of domains.

When you use a custom domain with Notion Sites, you’ll also have the option to remove any Notion branding for that custom domain. Learn more about customizing your Sites in [this article →](https://notion.so/help/edit-and-customize-your-notion-sites)

## [Delete a custom domain](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites#delete-a-custom-domain)

1.  Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Sites`.

2.  Next to your desired domain, select `•••`.

3.  From here, select `Delete` to remove your domain. If any Notion Sites have been published to the domain you’re trying to delete, you’ll be asked to unpublish those Sites before proceeding.

**Note:** When you delete a custom domain, you'll still be able to use it with Notion Sites until the end of your current billing cycle. After that time, you will no longer be charged for that custom domain.

## [Examples of incorrect DNS configurations](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites#examples-of-incorrect-dns-configurations)

In the setup below, the name of the TXT record is set to `notes` but should instead be `_notion-dcv.notes`. The value of the record is set to `_notion-dcv.notes` but should instead be the unique TXT record code provided in Notion when you’re setting up the custom domain.

In the setup below, the CNAME host is set to `external.notion.site` but should instead be set to your desired subdomain, like `careers.my-domain.com`. The CNAME value is correctly set to `external.notion.site`.

## [Setup instructions per DNS provider](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-a-custom-domain-with-notion-sites#setup-instructions-per-dns-provider)

Below are instructions for setting up your CNAME and TXT records with some of the most common DNS providers.
