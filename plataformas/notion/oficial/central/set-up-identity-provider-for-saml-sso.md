# Set up Identity Provider (IdP) for SAML SSO

In this help doc

## Here's how to set up your Identity Provider for SAML SSO in Notion.

[Jump to FAQs](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#faq)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are instructions for setting up Notion [SAML SSO](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration) with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, please let us know.

**Note**: Enterprise organizations can use more than one identity provider. Each provider is its own SAML configuration in your organization settings, and each configuration has its own `Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL` and Config ID. Set up a separate app for each provider, then follow the steps below once per provider. [Learn more about SAML configurations →](https://www.notion.com/help/saml-sso-configuration)

## [Entra ID](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#entra-id)

### [Step 1: Create a new application integration](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#step-1-create-a-new-application-integration)

To create a new application integration in Entra ID:

## [Custom SAML SSO configuration](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#custom-saml-sso-configuration)

If you don't use one of Notion’s supported SAML providers, you can also configure your IdP to use SAML with Notion.

### [Step 1: Set up your IdP](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#step-1-set-up-your-idp)

Your IdP must support the SAML 2.0 spec to be used with Notion. To set up your IdP:

1.  Configure the ACS URL to the value Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL from Notion. You can find this in `Settings` → `Identity & Provisioning` → `Edit SAML SSO Configuration`.

    - On the Enterprise Plan, the ACS URL is shown on each SAML configuration in your organization settings. Use the one for the configuration you’re setting up.

2.  Configure `NameID` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`.

    1.  Similarly, configure `username` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`.

3.  Configure `EntityID` to [https://notion.com/sso/saml](https://stg.notion.com/sso/saml). You can find this in `Settings` → the bottom of `Identity & Provisioning`.

4.  Configure the following attributes:

    - `emailAddress`: This is a user's email address. Most IdPs set this by default.

    - (Optional) `firstName`

    - (Optional) `lastName`

    - (Optional) `profilePhoto - `This must be a link to an image. When set, this replaces the user's Notion avatar when they sign in with a SAML SSO.

5.  Copy the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML for next steps.

### [Step 2: Set up SAML in Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#step-2-set-up-saml-in-notion)

To set up SAML in Notion:

You can enter your provider details, pick how people sign in, and turn on automatic account creation before you save. One save turns SAML on with the settings you picked.

1.  In Notion, go to `Settings` → `General` if you’re on the Business Plan, or the `General` tab of your [organization settings](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) if you’re on the Enterprise Plan.

2.  In the `Allowed email domains` section, add new email domains and follow the prompts to verify them. These must be email domains of your users logging into Notion.

3.  Select the `Identity` tab in `Settings` if you're on the Business Plan, or go to your organization settings → `General` → `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)` if you're on the Enterprise Plan.

4.  On the Enterprise Plan, select `Create configuration` to set up this provider, or open an existing configuration to change it.

5.  In `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)`** **settings, toggle `Enable SAML SSO` on. This will open the SAML SSO Configuration** **dialog.

6.  Under `Identity Provider Details`, input the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML from your IdP.

7.  Make sure you provide your desired inputs for `Login method`, `Automatic account creation`, and `Linked workspaces`.

## [Switch identity providers](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#switch-identity-providers)

To switch identity providers:

1.  In Notion, go to `Settings` → `General` if you’re on the Business Plan, or the `General` tab of your [organization settings](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls) if you’re on the Enterprise Plan.

2.  Select the `Identity` tab in `Settings` if you're on the Business Plan, or go to your organization settings → `General` → `SAML Single sign-on (SSO)` if you're on the Enterprise Plan.

3.  Enter your new information, then select `Save changes`.

4.  On the Enterprise Plan, you don’t have to replace your current setup. You can add a second configuration for the new provider, test it, then move your domains over and remove the old configuration when you’re ready.

When switching to a new IdP, we recommend that:

- SSO not be enforced during the transition, so you can minimize the risk of locking users out.

- Email addresses for the users under your new IdP match the user’s email in Notion.

- You move one domain at a time if you have several, so you can check each one before you move the next.

**Note**: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users.

## [Troubleshooting](https://www.notion.com/help/set-up-identity-provider-for-saml-sso#troubleshooting)

If you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your IdP's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so using [this online tool](https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.php).

Note that we do not support the `EntitiesDescriptor` element. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the contained `EntityDescriptor` element and try again.

If someone can’t sign in and your organization has more than one configuration, check that their email domain is added to the configuration you expect, and that the Config ID and ACS URL in the provider match that same configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQs

Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?

Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.

Can I still log in to Notion if my Identity Provider (IdP) is out of service?

Yes, even with SAML enforced, workspace owners have the option to log in with email. A workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disable `Enforce SAML` so users can log in with email again.

HC: Do I need a separate app in my identity provider for each configuration?

Yes. Each configuration has its own ACS URL and Config ID, so set up one app per configuration.
