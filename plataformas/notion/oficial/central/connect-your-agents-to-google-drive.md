# Connect your agents to Google Drive (beta)

In this help doc

## Learn how to connect your Notion Agent or a Custom Agent to Google Drive so it can find and work with your Drive files.

[Jump to FAQs](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#faq)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can connect your [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent) or [Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents) to Google Drive so they can search, read, write, and update files in real time.

This connection is tied to the person who set it up. When your agent uses Google Drive, it checks your Drive in real time. Nothing is saved or indexed by Notion. The agent can only access files you own, files that have been shared with you, and any Shared Drives you have access to.

## [What to know before you start](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#what-to-know-before-you-start)

- Make sure you can sign in to the Google account you want to use.

- You need to be a workspace member (not a guest), and Notion AI needs to be turned on for your workspace.

- Your Google Workspace owner may need to approve Custom Agents For Drive before you can connect. If Google Drive isn't approved for your workspace, ask a workspace owner to approve it. When a workspace owner connects, Google Drive is approved for the workspace automatically.

- Review the permissions shown by Google before allowing access.

- If your workspace controls which connections are allowed, a workspace owner may need to turn on Google Drive for Custom Agents.

- Connecting Custom Agents to Google Drive is different from the [Notion AI Google Drive connector](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors-for-google-drive) which is for [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent?_gl=1*1oedpsa*_gcl_au*NzYxMjYyNDY4LjE3ODI4NjIyNzI.*_ga*MTMyNTc2MTE1NC4xNzgyODYyMjcy*_ga_9ZJ8CB186L*czE3ODQwNjc2NDMkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzg0MDY4OTg5JGo1NyRsMCRoMA..).

## [Connect an agent to Google Drive](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#connect-an-agent-to-google-drive)

There are two ways to connect Google Drive. You can connect your Google account once from your settings, then add it to any agent. Or you can add Google Drive while you're working in a specific agent.

**Connect from your settings**

Do this to access Google Drive with Notion Agent and use the same Google account across more than one agent.

1.  Go to `Settings` → `Connections`.

2.  Select `Google Drive`.

3.  Select `Your account` → `Connect your Google Drive account`.

4.  Choose `Limited access` or `Full access`, then select `Connect`.

5.  Read the reminder, then select `Continue to Google`.

6.  Sign in with the Google account you want to use.

7.  On the next Google screen, check every Drive box. If any are left unchecked, your agents won't be able to run.

Your Google account is now connected to Notion. You can add Google Drive to any Custom Agent from its Tools and access settings.

**Connect from an agent**

1.  Open the Custom Agent you want to update.

    - Notion Agent uses the Google account you connect in

      `Settings` → `Connections`. There's nothing extra to set up in Notion Agent.

2.  Go to the agent’s `Settings` → `Tools and access`.

3.  Select `+ Add connection` → `Google Drive`.

4.  Follow the steps to sign in to Google and allow access. On the next Google screen, check every Drive box. If any are left unchecked, your agents won't be able to run.

    - Optional: Choose specific shared drives or folders to limit what the agent can access.

5.  Select `Save`.

Once you’re connected, you can choose exactly what your agent can access. In the agent’s **Tools & Access** settings, pick the specific Drive files or folders you want the agent to be able to view and/or edit.

To ensure the highest quality, mention Google Drive in your Custom Agent’s instructions or in your prompt to Notion Agent when you want it to search or update Drive files.

## [Choose an access level](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#choose-an-access-level)

When you add Google Drive, you'll choose how much the agent can do. You can change this later.

- **Limited access:** your agent can read any files the user can read, but can only edit files it has created or the user has selected.

- **Full access:** your agent mirrors user’s existing Drive permissions. It can read and edit any files the user can read and edit.

Your access level applies to all your agents. To change it, reconnect Google Drive and choose `Update Drive access`. Notion Agent always uses your full access level. To limit a Custom Agent to specific files or folders, use its **Tools and access** settings.

## [What to expect when you connect](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#what-to-expect-when-you-connect)

**Google asks you to approve access:** This is the normal setup flow. Pick the Google account you want, review what's being requested, and continue. Next, Google shows the Drive permissions for the access level you picked. You're connected once Notion says Google Drive is connected.

**You might not need admin review:** Many Google Workspaces let people connect new apps on their own. If your admin hasn't set a special rule for Custom Agents For Drive, you may be able to connect right away. Once an admin sets a rule for the app, that rule is what counts.

**Notion says "Connected" but you never saw a Google sign-in:** Notion may reuse a Google Drive connection you set up before. That's normal when it still works. If it's using the wrong Google account, or Drive isn't working, remove Google Drive under `Tools & access`, then connect again and pick the account you want.

## [Disconnect Google Drive](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#disconnect-google-drive)

You can remove Google Drive from every agent that uses it, or from just one agent.

**Remove your account from all agents**

This disconnects your Google account from every agent that was using it.

- Go to `Settings` → `Connections`, then select `Google Drive`.

- Select `Your account`.

- Next to your connected account, select `Disconnect` and confirm.

**Remove Google Drive from one agent**

1.  Open the agent and go to `Tools and access`.

2.  Select the three dots next to the Google Drive connection.

3.  Select `Disconnect`.

## [Add an optional trigger](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#add-an-optional-trigger)

When connecting a Custom Agent to Google Drive, you can set up a trigger so the agent checks Google Drive for changes. To do so, point it to a folder (or a Drive link) and choose how often it should look. If something changes, the agent will notice and run. You can watch a folder or a shared drive. Only files directly inside the folder are watched. Changes in subfolders don't trigger the agent, and you can't watch your entire `My Drive.`

## [Test the connection](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#test-the-connection)

Try one of these prompts to test your agent's connection to Google Drive:

- “Search Google Drive for ‘roadmap’ and tell me what you find.”

- “Create a Google Doc called ‘Weekly recap’ with a short summary of this week.”

## [What your agent can do in Google Drive](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#what-your-agent-can-do-in-google-drive)

**Once connected to Google Drive, your agent can:**

- Search across the Docs, Sheets, and Slides you can access.

- Edit existing Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, depending on the access you grant. For other files, like PDFs or Word documents, your agent can save an updated version as a new file.

- Copy, move, rename, and move files to trash.

- Read and summarize file content in real time.

- Read the text of a PDF.

- Create new docs, spreadsheets, presentations, and folders.

- Act on a trigger when files are updated.

**File types your agent can work with**

Your agent can read Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, plus PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV, and plain-text files (including HTML, JSON, XML, and YAML). Uploaded files, like PDFs and Office files, can be up to 10 MB. For very large Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides, your agent may read only part of the file at a time.

It can't read Google Drawings, Google Maps, Google Forms, images, video, audio, or zip files. If you point it at one of these, your agent will tell you it can't open the file. For Google Drawings and other Google file types, it asks you to open the file in Google Drive instead.

## [What your agent can access](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#what-your-agent-can-access)

Your agent only has access to what the connected Google account can access. If that Google account loses access to a file or folder, the agent loses access too.

Editors can remove the Google Drive connection for a Custom Agent. Only the person who connected the agent to Google Drive can add more access (like adding more folders).

## [Limit access for your agent](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#limit-access-for-your-agent)

It’s best to limit access to only the shared drives or folders your Custom Agent needs. This helps the agent stay focused and reduces risk.

On a shared Custom Agent, anyone with access to that agent can query the connected Google Drive.

## [What your agent can’t do in Google Drive](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#what-your-agent-can%E2%80%99t-do-in-google-drive)

- Connect to more than one Google account per agent.

- This connection only works with files in your Google Workspace. If a file is shared from a different Google Workspace, the Custom Agent won’t be able to access it.

- If the Custom Agent is shared, anyone who can use the agent can also search the Drive it’s connected to.

## [Fix connection problems](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#fix-connection-problems)

**"Your institution's admin needs to review this app"**

You'll see this when your organization hasn't approved one or more of the permissions the app needs. Only an admin can fix this one.

1.  Select `Request access`.

2.  Your Google Workspace admin gets the request under `Apps pending review`.

3.  Try connecting again after your admin approves the app and all of its permissions.

**"Access blocked: Authorization error"**

You'll see this when your admin has blocked the app for your account or your group. Reach out to your Google Workspace admin. They need to allow Custom Agents For Drive for your group before you can connect.

**It worked before but stopped**

Your Google access may have expired or been turned off, or your admin may have changed a rule.

1.  Reconnect Google Drive under `Tools & access`.

2.  If Google shows an admin block, contact your Workspace admin.

3.  If Google lets you in but Notion still can't connect, contact Notion support and share the error you see.

## [For Google Workspace admins](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-your-agents-to-google-drive#for-google-workspace-admins)

To let someone connect, allow Custom Agents For Drive for their group (organizational unit) and approve every Google permission their access level asks for.

**How Google decides which apps people can connect**

In your Admin console under `API controls` → `Settings` → `Unconfigured third-party apps`, the default setting lets people connect new apps on their own. With that default, people can connect Custom Agents For Drive without your review, as long as you haven't set a separate rule for it.

The other settings only allow basic Google sign-in info, or block all new apps. Any rule you set for a specific app overrides the default. Guests are managed through their own group.

This setting covers app sign-in access. Google Workspace Marketplace installs are managed separately.

**Set up Notion Agents For Drive**

Setting up the app yourself lets people connect even when new apps are limited to basic sign-in or blocked.

1.  Open `Admin console` → `Security` → `Access and data control` → `API controls` → `App access control`.

2.  Open Configured apps, then select `Configure new app`.

3.  Search using this exact OAuth client ID:

    `69206789846-avkmfeq0epeducrkoutjo361r8p5h103.apps.googleusercontent.com`

4.  Pick the groups whose people should be able to connect.

5.  Choose `Trusted` to allow every permission the app asks for, or choose `Specific Google data` and include every Drive and Google sign-in permission the connection needs.

6.  Review your choices and select `Finish`.

7.  Ask the person to connect again after the change takes effect.

**Review an app request**

When you review a request, check that:

- The app is Custom Agents For Drive.

- It's allowed for the person's group.

- Every Drive and Google sign-in permission is approved.

- A sub-group rule isn't quietly blocking it.

For **Specific Google data**, select every permission the connection asks for.

Google Workspace changes can take a while. Ask the person to connect again after the change goes through.

## FAQs

Why don’t I see Google Drive as an option?

Ask a workspace owner to check if Google Drive is allowed.

Why does setup keep failing?

First, make sure you’re signing in to the right Google account. If your organization controls Google app access, a Google Workspace admin may need to approve the connection.

You can also try an incognito or private window to avoid signing into the wrong account.

Why can’t my agent find a file?

Make sure the connected Google account can open the file in Google Drive. If you’ve limited access to certain drives or folders, make sure the file is inside those.

The agent can read a file, but can't edit it. Why?

Your agent can edit Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Other file types, like PDFs and Word files, can be read but not edited in place. Also make sure the connected Google account can edit the file. With limited access, your agent can only edit files it created or that you selected.

Is this the same as the Notion AI Google Drive connector?

No. The [Notion AI Google Drive connector](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-connectors-for-google-drive) is for Notion AI search. This article is about connecting Google Drive to Notion Agent or a Custom Agent so it can take actions like reading files and creating or updating Google Docs.

Can I restrict what my Custom Agent can access in Google Drive?

Yes. Choose specific shared drives and folders during setup.
