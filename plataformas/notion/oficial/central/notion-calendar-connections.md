# Notion Calendar connections & API

In this help doc

## Notion Calendar works with a lot of other tools that you already use in your day to day. It also works seamlessly with Notion.

## [Conferencing connections](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-calendar-connections#conferencing-connections)

For the best experience with setting up conferencing connections and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.

Notion Calendar connects with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing connections in Notion Calendar:

- Default connections: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.

- Connected connections: A connection you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected connection that Notion Calendar supports.

- Custom connections: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to `Settings` → `Conferencing` → `Conferencing providers` → `Add`. You can give your connection a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including [Around](https://around.co/), [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/), [Doxy.me](https://doxy.me/), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/), [Webex](https://www.webex.com/), and [Whereby](https://whereby.com/).

**Note:**

- If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you’ll be taken to the link from the event’s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.

- At this time, Notion Calendar doesn’t support FaceTime as a conferencing option.

### [Set a default conferencing option](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-calendar-connections#set-a-default-conferencing-option)

A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop.

Default conferencing is set at the calendar level. In Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` and select a calendar in the `Calendar accounts` section of the settings sidebar. Open the `Default conferencing` menu and select your preferred conferencing tool.

**Connect your Zoom account**

To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to `Settings` → `Conferencing`. Find `Zoom` and select `Configure`. When you’re redirected to your browser, make sure you’re logged in with the right Zoom account, then select `Authorize` to give Notion Calendar access.

Notion Calendar asks only for the [Zoom permissions](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes/) that we absolutely need to make sure the connection with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events. [Learn more about our security practices here →](https://www.notion.so/help/security-and-privacy)

**Passcode settings**

If you’ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in your [Zoom Profile Settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting), Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin's [passcode complexity requirements](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832).

**Disconnect your Zoom account**

To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to `Settings` → `Conferencing`. Find Zoom and select `Disconnect`.

If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom's [deauthorization and data compliance](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/deauthorization) guidelines.

**Note:**

- If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the connection, have an admin sign into [marketplace.zoom.us](http://marketplace.zoom.us/), search for Notion Calendar, and turn on `Pre-approve`.

- Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.

- If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.

### [Google Meet](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-calendar-connections#google-meet)

Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don’t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you’ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you’re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.

**Note:** If you don’t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn’t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin to [turn on Meet video calling](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9493952).

## [Notion connection](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-calendar-connections#notion)

Notion Calendar can be used with Notion. Add Notion pages to your event details for easy access and view important dates from Notion databases directly in Notion Calendar so you don’t have to track your database events separately from your other important plans.

## [Notion Calendar API](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-calendar-connections#notion-calendar-api)

Notion Calendar has a simple local API you can use to open Notion Calendar to a specific event from another tool. This works on desktop, on both macOS and Windows.

Here is an example schema:

`cron://`[`[email protected]`](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`&`[`[email protected]`](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`&startDate=2022-01-05T20:30:00.000Z&endDate2022-01-05T21:00:00.000Z&title=Test&ref=com.example.test`
