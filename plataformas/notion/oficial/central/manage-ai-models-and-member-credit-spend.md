------------------------------------------------------------------------

High credit consumption models are designed for complex, long-running work and cost substantially more than the models included in your plan. When a member picks a high credit consumption model with [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent), it draws on [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/category/notion-credits) from the start. High credit consumption models stay switched off in every workspace until a workspace owner turns them on, so nothing spends credits until you decide to allow it. Until then, they aren't available for [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent).

This article is for workspace owners. If you’re a member and a model you want is unavailable, read the section on [what members see](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#what-members-see) below.

## [Before you start](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#before-you-start)

- You need to be a workspace owner to change model and provider settings.

- Your workspace needs to be on the Business or Enterprise plan. Model controls aren't available during a Business trial.

- Your workspace needs [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/what-are-notion-credits) available to use high credit consumption models.

## [Turn off a high credit consumption model for your workspace](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#turn-off-a-high-credit-consumption-model-for-your-workspace)

Workspace owners can turn a high credit consumption model on or off for the workspace. Switching off an individual model stops members from picking that model for Notion Agent.

To turn off a high credit consumption model for your workspace:

1.  In your sidebar, go to `Settings` → `Notion AI`.

2.  Open the `Controls` tab.

3.  Find the model you want under the model controls.

4.  Uncheck the model to turn it off.

5.  Select `Save`.

Once a high credit consumption model is switched off, it becomes unavailable in the model picker and members can’t select it for [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent). Workspace owners can switch on a high credit consumption model at any time.

Turning off a whole provider also narrows what `Auto` can choose from and may lower quality, so you'll see a warning. Turning off a single model only hides it from the picker people choose from. It doesn't change `Auto`.

Organizations on the Enterprise plan can use the Admin API to update high credit consumption model settings across workspaces programmatically. Learn more about [Notion's Admin API →](https://developers.notion.com/reference/admin/intro)

**These model controls apply to** [**Notion Agent**](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent)

[Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/category/custom-agents) have their own model controls and model picker, so turning a high credit consumption model on or off for Notion Agent doesn’t change which models your Custom Agents can use. Learn more about how owners can [manage access to models for Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents#admins-manage-access-to-models-for-custom-agents) →

## [Restrict a model provider for your workspace](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#restrict-a-model-provider-for-your-workspace)

Choose which model providers your whole workspace can use. This ensures your team can only work with certain providers. Restricting a model provider applies to your whole workspace at once, and changes the quality and efficiency of Auto.

To restrict a model provider:

1.  In your sidebar, go to `Settings` → `Notion AI`.

2.  Open the model provider settings.

3.  Turn off any provider you don't want your workspace to use.

4.  Save your changes.

Once you save, restricted model providers will disappear from the model picker for Notion Agent and Custom Agents. To let the workspace select models from these providers again, you’ll need to re-add them.

**How provider restrictions affect Auto**

Restricting model providers will obstructs the way Auto works, and may lead to your workspace consuming credits faster. Before saving a change, workspace owners will see a notification that restricting a model provider will affect Auto’s efficiency.

## [Set how many Notion credits each member can spend](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#set-how-many-notion-credits-each-member-can-spend)

Workspace owners can cap how many [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/what-are-notion-credits) a person or group can spend using a high credit consumption model, so a single member or group can't use up the workspace's credits.

1.  In your sidebar, go to `Settings` → `Notion AI`.

2.  Open the `Credits` tab.

3.  Set the default credit limit. This applies to everyone in your workspace.

4.  To give a person or group more room, find the name and set a higher limit for them.

Owners can change a limit at any time. Raising someone’s limit takes effect right away.

You can set a custom limit for a single member, a whole group, or an agent, so you don't have to raise the default for everyone.

If you don't set a default limit, your workspace can't use purchased Notion credits once members run out of their included credits. Set a default limit to give the workspace access.

## [See who’s spending credits](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#see-who%E2%80%99s-spending-credits)

Workspace owners can go to `Settings` → `Notion AI` → `Usage` to see how many Notion credits each member can spend.

- Each member’s credit spend shows up as its own row, so you can see who is using credits and how much.

- The usage chart shows where your workspace is pacing for the month, so you can act before credits run low.

## [What members see](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#what-members-see)

- The model picker shows only models your workspace allows. Models your owner has restricted appear under

  `Restricted models` and can't be selected. If a model isn't listed at all, its provider may be turned off. Ask a workspace owner.

- When you choose a high credit consumption model in [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent), it uses [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/what-are-notion-credits), not your [Select credits](https://www.notion.com/help/standard-select-and-notion-credits-eligible-features).

- If you use up your Select credits and your credit limit, you can keep using the models included in your plan on [Auto](https://www.notion.com/help/auto), as long as you still have Standard credits available. Ask a workspace owner if you need a higher credit limit. Learn more about [Standard and Select credits →](https://www.notion.com/help/standard-select-and-notion-credits-eligible-features)

## [Who can use high credit consumption models](https://www.notion.com/help/manage-ai-models-and-member-credit-spend#who-can-use-high-credit-consumption-models)

- High credit consumption models are available on Business and Enterprise plans.

- A workspace owner needs to turn on each model before anyone can use it for [Notion Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-agent).

## FAQs

Will my workspace start spending Notion credits on its own?

No. High credit consumption models are switched off for Notion Agent in every workspace. Nothing spends credits until a workspace owner turns a model on.

Why can't I pick a high credit consumption model for Notion Agent?

Usually one of these things:

1.  A workspace owner hasn't turned that model on yet.

2.  You've used up your Select usage and reached your own credit limit.

3.  Your workspace is out of [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/category/notion-credits).

An owner can check these in `Settings` → `Notion AI`.

Who can change these settings?

Workspace owners on the Business and Enterprise plans.

I used Claude Fable 5 before. What changed?

Claude Fable 5 uses your workspace's [Notion credits](https://www.notion.com/help/category/notion-credits), not your [Standard or Select credits](https://www.notion.com/help/standard-select-and-notion-credits-eligible-features). A workspace owner must turn it on for your workspace before you can select it in Notion Agent. Your [Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents) and saved work aren't affected.

Why did a model disappear from my model picker?

A workspace owner may have restricted that model's provider for your whole workspace. When a provider is restricted, its models leave the picker for everyone. Ask an owner if you still need that provider.

I hid a model. Why is Auto still using it?

Hiding a model only stops people from picking it by hand. Auto can still use it on its own. To keep Auto from using a provider at all, restrict the provider instead.
