# Audit log

In this help doc

## Audit logs give Enterprise organization owners access to detailed information about security and safety-related activity. This can help identify potential security issues, investigate suspicious behavior, and troubleshoot access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** The audit log feature is available to [organization owners](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls#who-can-apply-organization-level-controls) on the Enterprise Plan. If you upgrade to an Enterprise Plan, audit log events are recorded starting from the time of upgrade. Prior events will not be included in the audit log.

Audit logs give you information about events that happen across your organization’s workspaces, as well as who took specific actions and when. Where available, the IP address is also included.

By default, all events are shown in reverse chronological order. You can use the filters at the top of the audit log to narrow down events by date, person, or event type.

Audit log events may take some time to appear after an action takes place. If you need to see events in real-time, use the custom SIEM integration, which streams events as they occur.

## [Access your organization audit log](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#access-your-organization-audit-log)

Notion has an organization audit log, where you can view events for your entire organization. You can also filter down to only events for a single workspace.

To see your organization audit log:

1.  Open the workspace switcher and select `Manage organization`. You may need to `Set up organization` first if you haven’t already. Learn more by reading [Organization level controls](https://www.notion.com/help/organization-level-controls).

2.  Select the `Data & Compliance` tab.

3.  Find and select `Audit log.`

## [Access a workspace audit log](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#access-a-workspace-audit-log)

Each workplace has it’s own workspace audit log, which can be accessed from the workspace settings.

To access a workspace audit log:

1.  Select the workspace name, then select `Settings`.

2.  Select `Audit log`.

## [Filter your audit log](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#filter-your-audit-log)

The following filters are available at the top of the audit log:

1.  **Organization (organization audit log only)**: View events for only one workspace or for your entire organization. When you choose `Organization`, the Event filter shows organization events instead of workspace events.

2.  **Date**: Filter events to a specific date or date range. Audit log history is retained for up to 365 days, so you can select any range within the past year.

3.  **Person or agent**: Filter by the user, integration, or agent that performed the action. Users who have since been removed from the workspace are still searchable and shown with a `Removed` label.

4.  **Event**: Filter by one or more event types. Events are organized by category (page, data source, teamspace, workspace, account, form, and workers). You can also use the workspace picker at the top of the audit log to view one workspace or your whole organization. When you choose `Organization`, the Event filter shows organization events instead of workspace events.

5.  **Teamspace**: Filter events by one or more teamspaces to see only what happened in the teamspaces you pick. This is useful when you want to review activity in one team's content without scrolling through everything else.  

    **Note**: You can only filter by teamspace events that were captured on or after August 9, 2026. Results before that date may be incomplete. Some events aren't tied to a teamspace at all, like account activity and most workspace-wide settings changes. Those don't show up when you filter by teamspace.

6.  **Related**: Filter for events that were triggered by the same underlying action. Some workspace changes generate a group of related events: for example, moving a page may log both a page moved event and a permission update. To filter for related events, hover over any audit log row and select the magnifying glass icon.

**Note**: The Related filter is only available for events that contain related activity metadata. If the magnifying glass icon doesn't appear on a row, that event has no related events.

To inspect individual audit log events to see if they are part of a group, hover over the audit log row and select the magnifying glass to filter for related events.

Some groups of audit log events are created as a consequence of the same user action.

To inspect individual audit log events to see if they are part of a group, hover over the audit log row and select the magnifying glass to filter for related events.

Actions taken with an admin token are recorded here too. The admin bot is listed as the person or agent that took the action, so you can tell automated work apart from work someone did by hand. You can filter by the bot name to see everything one automation did. Learn more in [Admin APIs for Enterprise organizations →](https://www.notion.com/help/admin-apis-for-enterprise-organizations)

## [Stream audit log events to your SIEM](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#stream-audit-log-events-to-your-siem)

You can use Notion’s custom SIEM integration to send a continuous stream of audit log events to your SIEM platform in real-time via webhooks. This includes all of the same audit log event types, except for organization events.

To set up the custom SIEM integration:

1.  Open the workspace switcher and select the `Settings` button.

2.  Go to the `Connections` tab and select `Custom SIEM integration`. You may need to use the search bar or select `See all` for this option to appear.

3.  Select the `Connect` button, then enter your webhook URL into the `Webhook URL` field. You can retrieve this from within your SIEM account settings.

4.  Select the `Connect` button to finish the process. All events in the audit log are sent in real-time to your SIEM endpoint as JSON payloads.

**What to know:**

- **Single webhook per workspace:** Only one custom SIEM webhook can be configured per workspace at a time.

- **Retry behavior:** If your endpoint fails to receive an event, Notion will retry up to seven times over approximately 24 hours.

- **No page content:** Event payloads include metadata (who did what, when, from where), but do not include the content of pages.

- **No syslog support:** Webhooks only; syslog is not supported.

- **No organization events:** the stream only includes workspace events. Organization events, like changes to organization settings or admin roles, only appear in the audit log in Notion when organization is selected.

- **Teamspace included**: Events that occur in a teamspace include the teamspace that owns the content, so your security team can point rules and alerts at a specific teamspace. This starts with events recorded on August 9, 2026.

- **Admin API events**: Most admin API activity is recorded as organization events, so it stays in the audit log in Notion and isn't sent to your SIEM.

For partner-specific SIEM setup instructions (Datadog, Panther, Splunk, Sumo Logic), see [Add security & compliance connections →](https://www.notion.com/help/add-security-and-compliance-integrations)

## [Audit log event types](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#audit-log-event-types)

6.  **Form events**: This includes events about forms connected to a database.

7.  **Data source events:** This includes events about data sources in a database.

8.  **Organization events (organization event log only)**: This includes events about your whole organization, like organization settings, security, and admin roles. To see these, choose `Organization` in the workspace picker at the top of the audit log.

## [Export your audit log](https://www.notion.com/help/audit-log#export-your-audit-log)

Want to analyze your audit log data in a spreadsheet or send it to external tools? You can export your audit log as a CSV. Your export will include only the events that match the filters you've set, so you get a smaller, more targeted file for investigations, audits, and compliance reviews.

To export your organization audit log:

1.  Open the workspace switcher and select `Manage organization`.

2.  Select `Data & Compliance`.

3.  Find and select `Audit log.`

4.  Optionally filter by organization, date, person, or event.

5.  Select `Export`.

To export your workspace audit log:

1.  Select the workspace name, then select `Settings`.

2.  Select `Audit log`.

3.  Optionally filter by organization, date, person, event, or teamspace.

4.  Select `Export`.

**Note:** The export will include any active filters applied at the time of export. You'll be able to view data going back 365 days up until 2 hours before the time of export. To save historical data, you'll want to `Export` audit log events regularly.
