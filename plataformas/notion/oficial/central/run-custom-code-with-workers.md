# Run custom code with Workers (beta)

In this help doc

## Learn what Workers are and what they’re used for.

[Jump to FAQs](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#faq)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notion Workers are part of our [Developer Platform](https://www.notion.com/help/what-is-the-notion-developer-platform). They run custom code on Notion's infrastructure to power:

- Database sync

- Tools for Custom Agents

- Webhook triggers

For technical setup, see the [developer documentation](https://developers.notion.com/guides/get-started/overview).

For more info about pricing, see [this article](https://www.notion.com/help/understand-pricing-for-workers).

## [What to know before you start](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#what-to-know-before-you-start)

- Workers are available on Business and Enterprise plans.

- By default, Workers are switched on for the workspace (owners only).

- Workspace owners can:

  - Keep Worker creation to owners only.

  - Allow specific members or groups to create Workers.

  - Turn Workers off for the workspace.

- If you're trying to deploy or manage a Worker, you’ll typically follow our [developer documentation](https://developers.notion.com/guides/get-started/overview) and use the [Notion CLI.](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-from-your-terminal-with-notion-cli)

- You can turn on Developer Mode to view Workers in Notion, read logs, and turn off or delete Workers. To deploy a Worker or change its code or setup, use the [Notion CLI](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-from-your-terminal-with-notion-cli) or your team’s coding tool.

## [Pricing & plan availability for Workers](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#pricing-&-plan-availability-for-workers)

To learn more about pricing for Workers, see [this article](https://www.notion.com/help/understand-pricing-for-workers).

## [Database sync](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#database-sync)

Database sync (powered by Workers) brings information from outside tools into a Notion database and keeps it up to date automatically. Once it's set up, the synced database stays current on its own, so your team and your agents always see the latest data without anyone copying or pasting between tools.

A few common examples:

- Sync Zendesk support tickets into a triage database.

- Sync Salesforce accounts into a pipeline tracker.

- Sync data from an internal tool or database.

Once it's live, the synced database behaves like any other database in Notion. Access is governed by your standard Notion sharing permissions.

## [Agent tools](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#agent-tools)

Agent tools (powered by Workers) extend what your Custom Agents can do beyond Notion's built-in actions and MCP, with capabilities tailored to how your team works.

A few common examples:

- Querying a data warehouse.

- Generating assets from a Notion doc.

- Taking action in another app that isn’t natively supported or available via MCP.

## [Webhook triggers](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#webhook-triggers)

Webhook triggers (powered by Workers) let an event in another tool kick off a workflow in Notion or any other connected system.⁠⁠⁠⁠

A few common examples:

- Closing a task when a pull request merges.

- Updating a CRM record when a subscription changes.

- Creating an onboarding doc when an offer is signed.

Once it's set up, the workflow runs automatically every time the event happens, so your team doesn't have to manually move information between tools.

## [Check Workers in Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#check-workers-in-notion)

With [Developer Mode](https://www.notion.com/help/turn-on-developer-mode-to-use-developer-tools-in-notion), you can open Workers from the developer section in your sidebar. Use this view for quick checks and basic actions. In Notion, you can:

- See all Workers in one list.

- Open a Worker and view Overview, Logs, Environment Variables, and Settings.

- Read Worker logs.

- Turn off or delete a Worker.

To deploy a Worker or change its code or setup, use the [Notion CLI](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-from-your-terminal-with-notion-cli) or your team’s coding tool.

## [Share a Worker](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#share-a-worker)

By default, only the person who created a Worker can modify and add it as a new connection. Share a Worker with teammates so they can connect it to a Custom Agent or help manage it.

## [If something isn’t working](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers#if-something-isn%E2%80%99t-working)

Try these steps in order:

1.  **Make sure your workspace is eligible, and that a workspace owner has turned Workers on.** Workers are available on Business and Enterprise plans, and require enablement from a workspace admin.

2.  **Confirm you’re using the intended setup path.** For most setups, you’ll use [Notion CLI](https://www.notion.com/help/use-notion-from-your-terminal-with-notion-cli) plus the [developer docs](https://developers.notion.com/guides/get-started/overview).

3.  **If your Worker deploy fails, check permissions next.** You may not have access to deploy to that workspace, even if you can view pages in it.

4.  **If your Worker runs but doesn’t change anything in Notion, test the action manually first.** If you can’t make the same change in Notion, it’s usually a permission or workspace-setting issue.

5.  **If cost looks higher than expected, lower the run frequency.** Workers that run more often will cost more. Start with a slower schedule, then increase once you’re confident it’s working.

6.  **Still stuck?** Follow the [developer documentation](https://developers.notion.com/guides/get-started/overview) for the specific error message. They’ll have the most accurate fix.

## FAQs

What’s the difference between Workers and Custom Agents?

Workers and [Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents) solve different problems, but they can work together.

- **Workers:** Run custom code on Notion’s infrastructure. Developers use Workers for things like automations, scheduled syncs, and custom integrations.

- **Custom Agents:** Handle repetitive work for your team automatically. You set triggers, and they run in the background with your workspace as context.

In some setups, a Worker can power a unique tool that a Custom Agent can use. For example, a Worker might fetch data from another system, and the agent can use that data to respond or take action.

Are Workers the same thing as Automations?

Not exactly. Automations are built into Notion and are designed for anyone to set up. Workers are for developers who want to run custom code. If you don’t need code, start with Automations.

Do Workers run on my servers?

No. Workers run on Notion’s servers, so you don’t need to set up or manage any infrastructure.

Do I need the CLI to use Workers?

Not always. You can view Workers, read logs, turn Workers off, and delete Workers in Notion with [Developer Mode](https://www.notion.com/help/turn-on-developer-mode-to-use-developer-tools-in-notion). You’ll typically need the [CLI](https://www.notion.com/help/run-custom-code-with-workers) or your team’s coding tool to set up, deploy, or change a Worker.
