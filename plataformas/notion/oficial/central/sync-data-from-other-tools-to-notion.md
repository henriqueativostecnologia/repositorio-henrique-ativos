# Sync data from other tools to Notion

In this help doc

## Bring data from tools like GitHub, Jira, and Salesforce into Notion databases that update automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our database syncs let you work with and enrich information from other tools alongside your team’s plans, docs, and projects. Connect an account, choose what to sync, and Notion creates the databases and keeps them updated.

**Moving from an older sync?** If you used an older sync for GitHub, Jira, Asana, or GitLab, those syncs stop updating on October 30, 2026. Your existing synced databases stay in Notion, but the data won't refresh after that date. The new sync creates new databases, so setting it up is a fresh start. Nothing moves over on its own, and you can run your old and new syncs side by side until October 30.

## [What you can sync](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#what-you-can-sync)

Notion manages these syncs so you can connect an account and use synced databases without building or maintaining the integration yourself.

[TABLE]

Each record from the other tool becomes a page in a Notion database. Fields from the source become database properties.

Managed syncs update data in one direction: from the connected tool to Notion. Synced properties are read-only in Notion. To change a synced value, update it in GitHub, Jira, or Salesforce. You’ll see the change in Notion.

Syncs run automatically in the background. Update timing varies by connection, the amount of data, and the source tool’s request limits.

**Note:** Need to connect another tool? If the tool you want to connect isn’t supported, use [Notion Workers](https://developers.notion.com/workers/guides/syncs) to build a custom sync, or follow our pre-built Workers Guides for [Asana](https://notion.notion.site/asana-worker-guide) and [GitLab](https://app.notion.com/p/notion/GitLab-Guide-Worker-Sync-3abefdeead0583b8b9b90172edb1ea0a).

## [Before you start](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#before-you-start)

You’ll need to be a member of the Notion workspace and have an account with access to the data you want to sync. Your organization may require an administrator to approve the connection or grant access in the source tool.

The account you use to create the sync determines which data Notion can read. If its permissions change or the connection expires, the sync may require you to re-authenticate.

GitHub Sync and Jira Sync require a Business plan (or the Mobile Business add-on). Salesforce Sync requires an Enterprise plan.

## [Set up a managed database sync](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#set-up-a-managed-database-sync)

1.  Open **Settings** → **Connections** in your Notion workspace.

2.  Open the connection you want to sync (GitHub, Jira, or Salesforce) from **Browse** or **Installed**, then choose **Database sync** from that connection’s options.

3.  Connect an account and complete the authorization steps for that tool.

4.  Choose the repositories, spaces, or object types you want to sync. For GitHub, you also choose whether to bring in pull requests, issues, or both.

5.  Choose how much history to include. For sources that offer custom properties, such as Jira and Salesforce, you can also choose which custom properties to include in your sync.

6.  Select **Create sync**.

Notion creates the databases in your **Private** sidebar section. The first import starts in the background. You can open the databases while records are still being imported.

## [How syncs run](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#how-syncs-run)

### [The first import](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#the-first-import)

Notion creates the database structure, then imports the records that match your settings. Large imports can take longer because Notion reads data in batches and follows the source tool’s request limits.

The database may show only part of your data while the first import is running. You don’t need to keep Notion open for the import to continue.

### [Ongoing updates](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#ongoing-updates)

After the first import, Notion regularly checks the connected tool for new or changed records and updates the synced properties. Syncs continue in the background even when no one is viewing the database.

In general we expect changes to sync to Notion in a few minutes or less.

Timing varies by connection, the amount of data, and the source tool’s availability. A check for changes doesn’t mean every change appears in Notion immediately. Salesforce checks for changes every minute by default; see each connection’s guide for details.

When the source temporarily limits requests or becomes unavailable, Notion retries. If the sync needs a new authorization or different permissions, its status tells you what to do.

### [History windows](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#history-windows)

You can include all available history or limit the sync to records updated in the last 30, 90, or 365 days. A history window uses the source record’s last update time, rather than its creation date. Salesforce uses its system modification time.

The window moves forward over time. A record can leave the database when it hasn’t been updated within that window, even if it’s still open or active in the source tool.

**Note:** A history window can remove pages. When a record falls outside the window, its synced page is removed from Notion, including any values you added to that page in your own properties. Choose all available history if you need to keep older, unchanged records.

Expanding the window imports additional matching records. Shortening it removes records that no longer qualify. This is different from a Notion database filter, which only changes what a view displays.

## [Use and share your synced databases](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#use-and-share-your-synced-databases)

You can create views, filter and sort records, and add your own Notion properties. For example, add a team priority to pull requests or an account planning status to Salesforce accounts. Values in these properties stay in Notion.

Give your own properties distinct names so they don’t conflict with properties managed by the sync.

If you stop syncing a property, its column stays in the database until you delete it. Turn the property off in the sync first, then delete the column. If you delete the column first, the sync adds it back.

The databases start as private pages. Share them using Notion’s page permissions when you’re ready.

**Note**: Notion sharing controls who can see the synced data. A person with access to the Notion database may be able to see records they can’t access in the source tool. Source permissions aren’t copied to each viewer in Notion. Review access before sharing.

A change to permissions in the source tool may stop future updates without removing data already in Notion. Review the Notion database’s sharing settings when source access changes.

## [Check sync status](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#check-sync-status)

Return to the connection’s **Database sync** settings to review the sync status, recent run information, and any error details.

[TABLE]

A recent run time shows activity. It doesn’t guarantee that every source change has already reached Notion.

## [Choose a managed sync or a Worker](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#choose-a-managed-sync-or-a-worker)

Use a managed sync when one of the supported connections includes the data and settings you need. Notion handles the initial import, recurring checks, and connection-specific sync logic.

Use a Notion Worker when you need to build a custom sync, such as importing from another service or transforming data before it reaches Notion.

[TABLE]

For example, use a managed GitHub sync to track pull requests and issues in Notion. Consider a Worker if you need a custom source, additional record types, or calculations that combine data before import.

## [Troubleshoot a sync](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#troubleshoot-a-sync)

### [Records are missing](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#records-are-missing)

Check the selected repositories, spaces, or object types, your history window, and the connected account’s source permissions. Also check whether the first import is still running and whether a Notion view filter is hiding records.

### [Relations are missing](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#relations-are-missing)

If a synced page should be related to another synced page but isn’t, it might be because of your history window, or the related page is still being imported. We only create relations when both pages are synced to Notion databases.

### [Updates have stopped](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#updates-have-stopped)

Open the sync’s status details. Reconnect if authorization has expired, or ask your source administrator to restore access. Temporary source outages and request limits can delay updates while Notion retries.

### [The sync has reached a row limit](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#the-sync-has-reached-a-row-limit)

Reduce the selected data or choose a shorter history window. Review the effect before saving: removing a source or shortening history can remove synced pages. The connection-specific guides explain what happens when you change a selection.

### [The sync has reached the property limit](https://www.notion.com/help/sync-data-from-other-tools-to-notion#the-sync-has-reached-the-property-limit)

Notion databases have a limit on how many properties they can hold. If a synced database reaches it, delete properties you don't need, or sync fewer properties. Turning a property off in the sync leaves its column in the database, so deleting those unused columns can free up room. Each connection's guide explains how to change what the sync includes.
