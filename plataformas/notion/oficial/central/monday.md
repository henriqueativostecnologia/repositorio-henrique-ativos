# Import from Monday.com

In this help doc

## Easily import your data from Monday into Notion.

[Jump to FAQs](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#faq)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Monday.com importer helps you bring your all Monday.com boards into Notion.

## [What imports (and what doesn't)](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#what-imports-(and-what-doesn't))

[TABLE]

## [](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#)[Monday.com](http://Monday.com) → Notion mapping

- If you import a board that **isn't a task or project board**, it will be imported as a regular database following your original board's structure.

- If you import a **task board and related projects**, tasks will be imported into the task database and a project will be created in the project database using the task board's name.

- If you import a **task board without any related projects**, tasks will be imported into the task database and a project will be created using the task board's name.

- Every teamspace in Notion gets one project and one task database per import. If you have multiple projects within one teamspace, all projects will go into the same database unless imported in batches. As a workaround, import additional projects into a separate teamspace and move them manually, or import your account in batches.

- The importer will import all information about task owners and due dates.

- An assignee in Monday.com **must be named** **`Owner`**, **`Assignee`**, or **`Person`** for that information to appear in Notion as an assignee. Any project or task board should only have one column to indicate an assignee.

## [Size limits & timing](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#size-limits-&-timing)

- Imports can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on size. You'll receive an email notification once your import is complete.

- For most reliable results, imports of up to **~8,000 tasks** and **~100 projects** are recommended. Larger imports may take several hours or fail.

  - **Tip:** Split large migrations into multiple batches.

- Review the progress of your import in `Settings` → `Import`. There you can see the status of your import and completed imports.

## [Import from Monday.com into Notion](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#import-from-monday.com-into-notion)

1.  Go to `Settings` in your sidebar → `Import` → `Third party imports` → `Monday.com`. Alternatively, use the `/monday` command in a page and select the option under `Import`.

2.  Enter your email and API token, which you can find using the instructions [here](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/authentication#accessing-api-tokens). Select `Authenticate` when you're done.

3.  Select your Monday.com workspace in the dropdown that appears. You can only import one workspace at a time.

4.  Choose your import type.

    - `Projects & Tasks` only: converts your project and task boards into project and task databases in Notion.

    - `Full Import`: imports all your board types as regular databases in Notion. You can exclude project and task boards from this and import them separately to make full use of Notion's project and task databases.

5.  Select the folders and boards you want to import.

6.  Choose an import location for your boards. For each board, you can send it to a teamspace (where Notion will create new databases) or select an existing database.

7.  If you import into an existing database, map your properties. For incoming relation columns (such as sub‑items, subtasks, or other board relations), you can map them to an existing relation property on the destination database, or choose to create a new property. Mapping to an existing relation loads the related database so you can confirm the match and map to those properties.

8.  Select `Next` to start the import. You can close the import window, the import will continue in the background.

9.  Once the import is complete, you'll receive an email confirmation.

## [What to expect after import](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#what-to-expect-after-import)

- All imported content lands in the teamspace you selected during setup.

- Task owners, due dates, and board structure are preserved where supported.

- Cross-board columns will only appear in Notion if the referenced board was also included in the import.

- Review and clean up your workspace before sharing with your team - permissions are not imported.

## [Limitations](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#limitations)

- Some column types won't be supported in the import, including: Buttons, Monday Docs, Integrations, Formula, Progress, Dependency, Time Tracking, World Clock, Ratings, and Auto Numbers.

  - **Tip:** Prep boards before importing — replace unsupported columns with supported ones where possible, or plan to recreate them in Notion afterward.

- Columns that point to another Monday board won't appear in Notion if that board wasn't included in the import.

  - **Tip:** Import related boards together, especially if there are cross-board links.

- Advanced features like dependencies, advanced timelines, and automations won't carry over.

  - **Tip:** Recreate these in Notion using relations, rollups, or timeline views.

- The import is a one-time event; future changes in Monday.com won't automatically reflect in Notion.

- You can import tasks from multiple workspaces, but you're limited to one workspace at a time.

- You can't preview an import beforehand.

## [Troubleshooting](https://www.notion.com/help/monday#troubleshooting)

- **Monday.com columns didn't migrate**

  - **Why this happens:** The column references another board that wasn't imported or the column type isn't supported (see Limitations above).

  - **To fix:** Import all related boards along with the main board, replace unsupported columns with supported ones before importing.

- **Assignee information didn't import correctly**

  - **Why this happens:** The assignee column wasn't named `Owner`, `Assignee`, or `Person`, or there were multiple assignee-type columns on the board.

  - **To fix:** In Monday.com, rename your assignee column to one of the supported names and ensure there is only one assignee column per board before re-importing.

## FAQs

Why aren’t all columns migrating to Notion?

If a missing column is linked to a board that **hasn’t been imported**, it won’t appear in Notion. To resolve this, make sure to import any related boards along with the main data.

Are all column types supported?

A few Monday.com columns are not yet supported in the import, including:

- Buttons

- Monday Docs

- Integrations

- Formula

- Progress

- Dependency

- Time Tracking

- World Clock

- Ratings

- Auto Numbers
