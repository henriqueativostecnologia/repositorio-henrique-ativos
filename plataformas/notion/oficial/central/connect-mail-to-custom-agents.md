In this help doc

## Automate your email workflows without ever leaving Notion.

[Jump to FAQs](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#faq)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom Agents can connect to Mail to automate email workflows. Once connected, agents can read, organize, draft, and send emails on your behalf through automated triggers or by chatting with the agent directly.

Mail connections work with Gmail, Notion Mail, or Outlook. Using Notion Mail isn’t required to use the Mail connection.

The Mail connection for Custom Agents is available on any plan with access to Custom Agents.

#### **Notion Mail-only actions**

## [How to connect Mail to your Custom Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#how-to-connect-mail-to-your-custom-agent)

1.  Chat with your agent. Give it specific direction on how to handle mail events.

    - This can also be done manually in a Custom Agent's **`Settings`.** Go to **`Tools & Access`**, then choose **`+ Add connection`** → **`Mail`** → **`Connect`.**

2.  Go to **`Settings`** → **`Tools & Access`.**

3.  Choose the inboxes you want your agent to have access to.

4.  Grant the permissions your agent needs: **Modify inbox, Draft**, and **Send**.

5.  Choose if the Agent should **Require confirmation** before executing an action.

6.  Test the connection. If the agent’s behavior isn’t what you expect, chat with your agent to clarify instructions.

**Tip:** Be specific in your instructions. For example: "Archive all emails from newsletters with the word 'weekly' in the subject line" or "Draft a polite reply to customer inquiries and save them for my review."

## [Mail triggers in Custom Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#mail-triggers-in-custom-agent)

Add a mail-based trigger in your Custom Agent’s **`Settings`**.

1.  Go to `Triggers`. Click **`+ Add trigger`** → **`Mail`** → **`Connect`**.

2.  Under Mail, choose from the following triggers:

    - **New email received**: Runs when a new email arrives in the connected mailbox.

    - **New email sent**: Runs when you send a new email from the connected mailbox.

    - **New email received or sent**: Runs when a new email is either received or sent.

    - **Label applied to email**: Runs when a specific label is applied to an email.

3.  Choose the Inbox you want the trigger to run on.

4.  Add a **filter** to narrow which events fire a Mail trigger. Each trigger can be filtered to only run when an email fits a specified **From, To, Subject, Body,** or **Domain** attribute.

## [Mail permissions in Custom Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#mail-permissions-in-custom-agent)

When you connect Mail, you can choose your Agent’s permissions:

- **Modify inbox**: Archive, trash, apply labels, set reminders, block senders, and unsubscribe.

- **Draft**: Create drafts.

- **Send**: Send emails from your account.

- **Require confirmation**: Requires a user to approve or cancel an action before it executes. When toggled off, the agent can take the allowed actions without approval.

**Tip:** Use permissions and triggers (like running only when a label is applied) if you want to restrict which emails the agent processes.

## [Sharing Custom Agents with Mail connections](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#sharing-custom-agents-with-mail-connections)

If you share a Custom Agent that’s connected to Mail, anyone who has access to that Agent can view emails in the connected inbox. A warning will be shown before taking this action.

## [Example instructions for Custom Agent](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#example-instructions-for-custom-agent)

To get the best results, give your Custom Agent specific instructions.

#### **Inbox organizer**

Automatically triage incoming messages by applying labels, archiving low-priority emails, and setting reminders for important ones.

**Tell your Custom Agent:** *"When I receive an email, check if it's a newsletter. If yes, apply the 'Newsletter' label and archive it. If it's from a customer, star it and apply the 'Customer' label."*

#### **Inbox cleanup assistant**

Unsubscribe from unwanted mailing lists and archive or delete promotional emails automatically.

**Tell your Custom Agent:** *"Review my inbox for subscription emails. Unsubscribe from any newsletters I haven't opened in 30 days and archive them."*

#### **Email-to-database sync**

Extract key information from emails and create or update records in a Notion database.

**Tell your Custom Agent:** *"When I receive an email from a new contact, create a page in my CRM database with their name, email, and company. Add a link to the original email."*

#### **Auto-reply assistant**

Draft responses to common inquiries and save them for your review before sending.

**Tell your Custom Agent:** *"When I receive an email asking about pricing, draft a friendly reply with our standard pricing information and save it as a draft for me to review."*

## [Troubleshooting](https://www.notion.com/help/connect-mail-to-custom-agents#troubleshooting)

If your Custom Agent encounters errors, give the run a “thumbs down” and chat with the Agent to diagnose the issue. Then try these steps:

**Connection errors**

If you can’t find Mail in Tools & Access, Mail disconnects, or your agent says it can’t access email:

- Confirm your Agent is connected to the correct email account.

- Verify you have permission to edit the agent (**Can edit** or **Full access**).

- Disconnect and reconnect the Mail connection, then refresh Notion.

- Confirm you've saved after updating any settings.

**Trigger errors**

If your agent isn’t running when email is received, is running multiple times, or can’t access email content:

- Check the agent’s **Activity** to confirm whether the trigger is firing vs. firing but failing.

- Verify the Mail connection is still active in **Tools & Access.**

- For label-based triggers, confirm the label name matches exactly.

## FAQs

Can my agent send emails without my approval?

Yes, if you give it the **send** permission and include sending in your instructions. If you want to review emails before they’re sent, instruct your agent to save drafts instead.

Which email providers work with this connection?

Mail connections work with Notion Mail, Gmail or Outlook.

Using Notion Mail is not required to make use of the Mail connection capabilities.

Do Custom Agents have access to all my emails?

Custom Agents can only access emails in accounts you’ve connected to Notion and explicitly granted permission to access when setting up the connection.

Can a Custom Agent manage multiple Gmail addresses?

Yes. You can connect more than one Gmail address with your agent. This can also be done manually in a Custom Agent's **`Settings`.** Go to **`Tools & Access`**, then choose `+ `**`Add connection`** → **`Mail`** → **`Connect`**.

If you are a Notion Mail user, you can add additional email addresses via the **`Notion Mail UI`**. Click on the **`account switcher`** → **`+ Connect another address`**.
