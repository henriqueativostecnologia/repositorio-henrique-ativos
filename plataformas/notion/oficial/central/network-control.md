# Network control

In this help doc

## Workspace owners can use a proxy to control which Notion workspaces people can sign in to on a corporate network.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this feature, Workspace Owners can manage which Notion workspaces are accessible on their corporate network using their proxy or cloud access security broker (CASB) solution.

If you're a Workspace Owner, this article will show you how to approve Notion workspaces using an SSL proxy within your corporate network. By restricting connections, you can prevent users on your network from signing in to unauthorized workspaces.

**Note:** Network control is only available for workspaces on Notion's [Enterprise Plan](https://www.notion.so/Plans-pricing-6067b27f7a244ccc8320c984baea61d7). [Contact sales to learn more →](https://notionup.typeform.com/to/FbZ6Tk)

## [How it works](https://www.notion.com/help/network-control#how-it-works)

Workspace Owners can set up an on-premises or cloud-based proxy server to intercept traffic to `notion.com` and its subdomains (`*.notion.com`). The proxy adds an HTTP header (`X-Notion-Allowed-Workspaces`) that lists the workspaces your team can use.

**Point your proxy at the right addresses.** Apply the header to notion.com and all of its subdomains (`*.notion.com`). If you set it up only for `notion.so`, people on your network may still be able to sign in to workspaces you haven't approved.

**Once enabled:**

- Your team will be able to access the approved workspace(s) and continue using Notion normally.

- If anyone tries to sign in to a workspace that isn't on the approved list, they'll see an error message.

  - If a user has an active session and joins a corporate network, they will see an error message.

## [Approve workspaces for your network](https://www.notion.com/help/network-control#approve-workspaces-for-your-network)

1.  **Check your proxy server:**

    - Make sure your proxy server supports SSL interception. We recommend referring to your product or service for details on how to configure the HTTP header.

2.  **Identify workspace IDs:**

    - You can find this in Notion via `Settings` → `Identity` → scroll to the bottom to see `Workspace ID`.

3.  **Configure the HTTP header:**

    - Add the header X-Notion-Allowed-Workspaces and set its value to a comma-separated list of allowed workspaces. Apply this header to traffic for `notion.com` and its subdomains (`*.notion.com`).

**Note**: Network control covers people signing in to Notion. It doesn't cover calls made with an admin token from Notion's [admin APIs](https://developers.notion.com/reference/admin/intro), so plan where those calls run and keep tokens in a secrets manager.

To make sure Notion works on your network, also allowlist Notion's domains and IP addresses. See [Notion IP addresses & domains](https://www.notion.com/help/allowlist-ip).
