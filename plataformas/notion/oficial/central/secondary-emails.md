### [Default settings for managed users](https://www.notion.com/help/secondary-emails#default-settings-for-managed-users)

- Users on verified domains cannot add secondary emails unless an admin enables the setting

Administrators can manage secondary emails for their users through:

- **Audit logs:** Track all secondary email add, remove, and primary email change actions

### [SSO with secondary emails](https://www.notion.com/help/secondary-emails#sso-with-secondary-emails)

If your organization uses SSO, users can sign in with any verified email as long as your Identity Provider (IDP) supports those email addresses.

For example, if a user has both [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#701a031d19041830131f1d00111e095e131f1d) and [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#12787d7a7c3c617f7b667a52717d7f62737c6b3c717d7f) configured in your IDP, they can use either email to sign in via SSO

- **Maximum secondary emails:** Up to 5 secondary emails per account

- **Uniqueness:** Each email address can only be associated with one Notion account

## FAQs

Can I log in with any of my email addresses?

Yes. You can log in to Notion using your primary email or any verified secondary email on your account.

What happens when someone shares a page with one of my secondary emails?

The page will appear in your Notion account. Shares to your primary email or any secondary email resolve to the same account.

Do mentions work with secondary emails?

Yes. If someone @mentions any of your email addresses, you'll receive the notification and it will reference your account.

Is this the same as a recovery email?

Secondary emails are more than just recovery emails. While they do help with account recovery, they're full email addresses that work for login, sharing, and mentions: not just recovery purposes.

Can I add an email that's already used by another Notion account?

No. Each email address can only be associated with one Notion account. If you need to use an email that's currently on another account, you'll need to remove it from that account first.

Can enterprise users add personal email addresses as secondary emails?

This depends on your organization's policy. If your organization has set the policy to "Only verified domains," you can only add secondary emails that match your company's verified domains. If the policy is set to "Disabled," you cannot add any secondary emails.
