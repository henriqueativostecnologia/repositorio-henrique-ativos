# Custom Agents security features

In this help doc

## We know your workspace data is important. Here's a look at the built-in security features for Custom Agents that help keep your workspace safe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom Agents operate with their own independent permissions separate from individual user permissions. This means anyone who can use an agent might access information through it that they couldn't access directly. Custom Agent security features help you control this access to keep your data safe.

For general Notion AI security practices, see [Notion AI security & privacy practices](https://www.notion.com/help/notion-ai-security-practices) and [How Notion 3.0 protects against prompt injection risks](https://www.notion.com/help/how-notion-protects-against-prompt-injection-risks).

## [Built-in security features](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#built-in-security-features)

Custom Agents include multiple layers of protection to help you avoid sharing sensitive information.​

### [Admin controls](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#admin-controls)

Workspace admins can manage Custom Agents across the organization through an Agent Directory, creation controls, content search, audit logs, AI analytics, and ownership transfer tools to maintain visibility and control over all agents in the workspace.

Learn more about Admin controls [here.](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-sharing-and-permissions)

### [Warnings when sharing private resources](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#warnings-when-sharing-private-resources)

You'll see a clear warning explaining what sensitive resources the Agent can access and asking you to confirm you want to share it. This includes warnings for:

- Private Notion pages

- Email or Calendar data

- Third party integrations

- Access to all pages that are shared with everyone in the workspace

These warnings help you pause and consider whether everyone you're sharing with should have access to the agent's resources.

### [Stricter edit permissions for third-party integrations](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#stricter-edit-permissions-for-third-party-integrations)

To prevent unintended data sharing through Slack and other third-party connected apps:

- For each Custom Agent, only the person who connected an integration can add more Slack channels or increase access (for example, from `Read Only` to `Read & Reply`).

- Users with “Can Edit” access can remove third-party connections, but cannot expand what the connection can see.

To edit third-party connection settings an editor did not set up, they must remove and then reconnect the integration.

Learn more about security for third-party connections in [this article.](https://www.notion.com/help/security-best-practices-for-agent-connections)

### [Automatic editor access checks](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#automatic-editor-access-checks)

Custom Agents include automatic security checks to prevent agents from continuing to access data if editors don't have the correct permissions:

- Each connected resource must have at least one Agent editor that has access to that resource

- If all editors lose access to a resource, the agent stops running.

This prevents "orphaned" agents from continuing to access sensitive data after everyone who set them up has left the team or lost access.

### [Visibility in share menus](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#visibility-in-share-menus)

Custom Agents appear in the share menu of any page or database they have access to, just like people do.

- You can see which agents have access to a specific page or database.

- Shows clearly which agents can view or edit your content.

- Allows you to audit access at a glance.

To check, open any page or database, click `Share`, and look for Custom Agents in the list. If you have Full Access to the page or database, you'll see their permission level and can remove them if needed.

### [Settings transparency for all users](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#settings-transparency-for-all-users)

Anyone with `Can view and interact` permission can see the agent's full settings page in view-only mode.

**What users can see:**

- Agent instructions.

- Which pages and databases the agent has access to.

- Connected tools and triggers.

- All configuration details.

Users with `Can view and interact` permissions can view agent settings but cannot edit, share, or modify the agent.

### [Admin controls for Custom Agents](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#admin-controls-for-custom-agents)

Workspace admins can manage Custom Agents across the organization through an Agent Directory, creation controls, content search, audit logs, AI analytics, and ownership transfer tools to maintain visibility and control over all agents in the workspace. Admins can also [manage access to specific AI models](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents#admins-manage-access-to-models-for-custom-agents) for Custom Agents.

### [URL confirmation](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#url-confirmation)

Custom Agents ask for confirmation before accessing unexpected external links:

- If an agent generates a URL that wasn't in your original prompt, it pauses and asks for confirmation.

- You'll receive a notification to review and approve the URL before the agent proceeds.

### [Choosing the right model](https://www.notion.com/help/custom-agents-security-features#choosing-the-right-model)

When working with Notion AI, you may use the model picker to control the model that you work with. If you hover over the model, you’ll see details like the speed, intelligence, and cost. Smaller models are generally faster and cheaper to work with, but we’ve applied a warning that they “may be more vulnerable to prompt injection”.

While Notion maintains security controls that help protect against [prompt injection](https://notion.com/help/how-notion-protects-against-prompt-injection-risks), your model choice also plays a role. AI models vary in size in terms of parameters (the internal, trainable numerical values that shape how the models operate). The more parameters a model has, the better it tends to perform on complex tasks, including distinguishing legitimate instructions from malicious ones. Smaller models tend to be more susceptible to following adversarial instructions, increasing the risk that they perform unintended actions when processing external content.

For workflows involving sensitive data or content from external or untrusted sources, such as uploaded files, shared documents, or web content, consider selecting a larger model. Regardless of which model you use, careful handling of untrusted content is one of the most effective steps you can take to protect your data.
